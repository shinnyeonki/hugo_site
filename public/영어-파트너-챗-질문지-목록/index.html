    <h1>영어 파트너 챗 질문지 목록 **page.html**</h1>
    <ol>
<li>What is something you are mad about?<br>
I really enjoy getting enough sleep.
<ol>
<li>why<br>
if i get enough  sleep and wake up I feel great the next day.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>What kind of person are you?<br>
Actually, I’m not sure exactly what kind of person I am yet, but I know that what I want to be, i went to be easygoing! because Being too serious feels exhausting. sometime i asked for me Could I become more relaxed? It might take time, but I think it’s worth it.</li>
<li>When was the last time you felt happy or angry? Can you tell me about it?<br>
Yesterday! It was the weekend, so I spent the whole day sleeping. I felt happy just being lazy. Thank goodness for rest—I think that’s something we all need.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What’s it gonna take for the good life?</p>
<p>I hate having to hurry because of unexpected things. i think good life means staying calm and peaceful most of the time, without constant interruptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t think money is directly but it still seems like a pretty important factor. what do you think about that?</p>
<p>money isn’t everything, but having at least the minimum is essential. but It doesn’t create happiness, it helps avoid stress—so it matters, just not as the main thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there someone you know who seems to be living a really good life? If so, tell me about them!</p>
<p>Yes! It’s my friend. He’s really good at keeping stress low because he sees himself objectively—never letting emotions take over. Happiness just seems to come easily to him.
I don’t want to be exactly, but I’d love <strong>to have</strong> that mindset—and honestly, it’s something that <strong>can be learned</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
